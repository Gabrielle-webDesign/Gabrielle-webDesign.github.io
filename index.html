        <h1>Poem</h1>
        <h2>On Midnight</h2>
        <h3>Gabrielle Savage</h3>
        <p>It all begins with a <em>whistle</em> and <strong>boom</strong>.  <br>
<br>An explosion of blazing colors coupled with messy, skin-sticky confetti and glitter of gold, silver and black,<br>  
Bubbly golden champagne washes remnants of plump grapes and tangy cheese & buttered bread,<br>  
Sparklers pop and illuminate dark but lively rooms, new stars for the sun.<br><br>  
  
Scarlet and gold swinging lanterns are stars for the moon,<br> 
A brilliant jade dragon prancing in the cleaned crips smelling street, spitting bills & coins,<br>  
Hot green tea is spilled over china plates of noodles, lemony fish, and chewy moon cakes.<br><br>   
  
Golden sunsets on crumbling but still strong cities draped in silks of cherry, pearl, and rose, waltz in the streets to strumming violins,<br> 
Underneath the flowery perfume clouds, on black-wired balconies, china boats of seared steak, garlicky pasta, and ripe berries on a flowing river of nectar wine and gooey chocolate,<br>  
Dried but still heavenly flowers tucked into delicate letters.<br><br>  
  
A parade marches through bumpy cobbled roads, dressed in various clothes of Veridian from emerald, to parakeet, and shamrock, carrying pouches of metallic yellow coins,<br>
Jooyuflly shouting olde tunes, sloshing pints of stour with salty bacon and savory cabbage,<br>
Rolling fields of cushioned and honey-dewed four-armed clovers, that house leathery snakes.<br><br> 
  
A birched picnic table holds a spread a supper to last a lifetime, of candied carrots & roasted ham with a sweating glass of red punch,<br>
Merrymakers draped in soft shades of pink, blue, & yellow, prance mindfully through meadows of blossomed pointed tulips & nestled lilacs,<br>  
Fuzzy bunnies & chicks, chirp, thump, and play ball and take shelter behind splotchy colored eggs.<br><br>  
  
Towering decrepit castles are nestled into the jagged stone of icy monstrous mountains, creepy but homely villages surrounding the foot, home to various devils & ghouls,<br> 
Howling marks the witching hour every hour on chilled winds, phantoms and ghouls roam the bumpy stone roads, shadowed in cloaks of mulberry, moss, & coal<br> 
Big amber lanterns with toothy grins and triangle eyes light the foggy paths their way, clutching baskets of creamy candy corn & apples of the salted, sweet, & soured kind.<br><br>  
  
Straw scarecrows with wool-scarfed necks welcome black crowing crows with open arms,<br>  
Hidden in woodsy pines painted in current, sunflower, and russet, the people of the forest and of the villages,<br>  
Crackling bonfires roast a big seasoned wild bird and charred corn on an open flame, sweet berries & crisp apple cider by the running river.<br><br> 
  
Blistering winds drag in heavy blankets of plush snow, warm hugs are found inside toasty-logged cabins,<br> 
Metallic and patterned boxes of fire truck red and deep green surround the foot of pine evergreens, singing bells swing from the point branches,<br>
Cold glasses of milk are set next to plates of warm gooey cookies of chocolate and spicy gingerbread, all within a grandfather's home.<br><br>
  
All filled with laughter,<br>  
All filled with family and friends,<br>  
All filled with remembrances, old and new,<br><br>  
<strong><em>And it all ends and begins again with a whistle and boom.</em></strong>
